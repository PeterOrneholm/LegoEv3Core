# LegoEv3Core
A minimal fork of the popular [BrianPeek/legoev3](https://github.com/BrianPeek/legoev3) that targets .NET Standard to be able to use it from .NET Core, UWP and other compatible platforms.

The library provides APIs to communicate with a [Lego Mindstorms EV3](https://www.lego.com/sv-se/mindstorms/products/mindstorms-ev3-31313) brick, control motors and read sensor values.

The project is work in progress and at the moment Bluetooth support is disabled and it has only been tested on Windows Desktop.
